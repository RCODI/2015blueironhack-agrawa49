What I am planning to make for this challenge is a website which is going to help new residents of West Lafayette/Lafayette find homes to rent based on their needs. At first, I will ask their age group to determine which locality would be perfect for them. Then I will ask if they are related to Purdue University in any way so that I know whether the distance from the university matters or not. Then I will ask them a few questions which will help me know the interests of the user and determine a locality which match their needs. A few topics which will be covered in the questions are food preferences (dine/cook), store distance, public transport, libraries, hospitals, education facilities, entertainment, closeness to work and some more. I plan to use the climate data, higher education in the state of Indiana data, hospitals in Indiana data, fire stations in Indiana data from data.gov.
